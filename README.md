#Hexagonal-Grid

This is a test for a game in JavaScript based on a boardgame called Triplanetary.

This game will have:

	1. Orbiting Planets
	2. Newtonian Space Travel
	3. Turn Based Movement and Combat phase.
	4. Resource based system (Fuel, Economy, Material) 
	5. Mouse controls
	6. Planetary Control
	7. Spacecraft building
	8. Interplantary Trade
	9. Enemy AI
	10. Gravity Wells (direction change and orbiting)
	11. Asteroid mining base
	12. Moon Base
	13. Scenarios
	14. Game Menu
	15. Save Feature
	16. Collisions
	
Added so far:

	1. Gravity Wells (orbiting)
	2. Newtonian Space Travel
	3. Mouse controls
	4. Turn Based Movement
	5. Collisions
	
Current Bugs:

	1. If two spacecraft share a movement hit box, both will be 
	triggered when that hitbox is activated.
	2. Collisions only register when the craft lands on the planet or spacecraft.
	Not when it's passing thorugh it.
	

Current List of things to add:
